                            <h2>The New Normal</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">“People are afraid of what they do not understand.” – Michael J. Sullivan (2008).</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/thenewnormal.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>The beauty of life is what people have termed “ABNORMAL”. The things that are different, impossibilities, these are considered ABNORMAL. But nobody has actually sat to think that these abnormalities are what make life a whole lot more fun to live and eventually become normal. When everything is absolutely normal, where is the fun? Where is the source of fascination? What would scientists think of? Who would think differently to bring about new ideas? No airplanes, no light bulb, no electricity, no mobile phones. Now imagine a world without all these…</p>

                            <p>Orville & Wilbur Wright thought differently and invented the airplane. Alexander Graham Bell thought differently and invented the telephone. Thomas Edison thought differently and invented the light bulb. Even Jesus Christ was “queer”, his thoughts, actions and way of life were completely different. All these men did the impossible because they saw the world with a different view. Jesus defied the rule of gravitation when he ascended into Heaven (Acts 1:9-12). He performed miracles, turned water to wine, healed the sick regardless of the law of healing on Sabbath(Mark 3:1-6) and delivered the oppressed, and was still condemned and nailed to a cross for just being different.</p>

                            <p>Naturally, there are three reactions of humans to things that are different.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Some humans are AMAZED; they don’t want to believe it even while staring right at it. They do not hate it but just ignore its existence.</li>
                                <li>Some humans are INTRIGUED; they are fascinated by it. They embrace the possibility and accept and appreciate its existence.</li>
                                <li>While others are AFRAID; they are scared because they do not understand why abnormality should exist. These calibers of people are the ones who get violent at the sight of the impossible. They are afraid of what they do not understand and eventually resort to violence.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>In my opinion, there are no such things as impossibilities, people just fail to dream or imagine and actually work towards it. Because something is different does not mean it is not normal. To the white men, black men were like adifferenttype of people(perhaps homo inferior) but later they embraced it as the new normal. “Heterosexuality is not normal, it is just common”. Homosexuality is as old as time itself. The fact that homosexuality is different from heterosexualitydoes not make it an abnormality. It is a way of life just like heterosexuality. Homosexuals were created just exactly the same way heterosexuals were created. Homosexuality is not a choice for homosexuals, we were born this way. It is time heterosexuals face it and embrace the idea that:

                                “ABNORMAL IS THE NEW NORMAL”.</p>

                            <h2>Change in Perception</h2>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/change.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>There’s a problem I feel most gay men seem to overlook because of certain factors they believe doesn’t apply to them or they consider too insignificant to dwell on. There is a statement I once heard and it was acknowledged as wise and appropriate by the community paying attention to the commenter, and it left me in wonder as to how ignorant we can be in this day and age.</p>

                            <p>The statement went thus: “Because I am gay and I fuck ass and not pussy, I shouldn’t be scared of getting the other person pregnant, so therefore the use of condoms does not apply to me.”</p>

                            <p>The use of condoms has been generally adopted by most readers and commenters of this blog (from what I read daily), but I do not think it has been emphasized enough. I believe ignorance plays a key role in the misconception of condom use, and the hostile LGBT clime in Nigeria isn’t exactly helping to make education regarding emphasis on the use of condoms amongst gay men pertinent, and this is saddening.</p>

                            <p>Call me paranoid but I believe that the use of condoms shouldn’t be restricted only to random hookups or one-night stands or shag partners.  The use of condoms should be extended to even relationships and amongst partners. Believing that because one is in a relationship, and because the two partners involved have had full disclosure about their HIV and other health statuses, then the use of condoms during lovemaking is unnecessary is the general mentality that has pervaded the Nigerian LGBT community. It is terribly wrong and should be corrected.</p>

                            <p>So yes, your boyfriend was a virgin and you are certain you were the one who disvirgined him, pause and remember, before you get frisky at night without protection, that HIV isn’t transmitted only through sex, and the fact that he is a virgin doesn’t preclude him from getting infected through other means. But because he thought himself safe due to his virginity, under such a false sense of security, he may not feel the need to have himself checked and would just assume he’s clean (because he’s never had his hair cut or a pin prick in all his life). And then, all these considered, you decided to consummate your relationship over and over again without protection. That is how ignorance fosters the lack of attention to safety.</p>

                            <p>Even if the two partners have gotten tested to know they’re HIV negative, there are several other sexually-transmitted diseases out there to consider. There are Genital Herpes, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Hepatitis B, Syphilis, etc. and most of them aren’t exactly as obvious as others. Some take a whole lot of time to manifest, some others do not even have obvious symptoms till they start damaging internal systems. And then you’ll start wondering what happened and from where it all came and who is haunting you from the village and making life unbearable for you, all the time not pausing to remember how reckless you’d been.</p>

                            <p>And then, there’s the appropriate usage of condoms. Yea, you already know about the importance of using condoms and you adopt it always, but some of us do not use it appropriately. I once had a conversation with a friend about condom usage with an HIV+ person. He claimed he could go through with it only if the condom was doubled (using two condoms together). It was disheartening to hear this. Doubling condom isn’t recommended as a safer sex method.  In fact, using two condoms at a time (aka double-bagging) increases the friction between the condoms and this makes it most likely to rip or tear, therefore exposing you to the risk you are trying to avoid.</p>

                            <p>I cannot overemphasize the use of appropriate lubricants to go along with condoms. This is a major reason why there are condom breakages. Anal sex generally requires a whole lot of lubrication even when there’s no condom involved. And so, typically, lubricants are needed to grease up the rectum to ease the entry when there’s protection. Applying lotions, creams or oils make it more likely for the condom to tear. It is not even advisable to use oil-based lubricants with condoms. The best types of lubricants that can be used in this situation are the water-based lubricants. A good example of this is ‘Lubrica’ and it is affordable and widely available in pharmacies. The only reason why I wouldn’t use it is because it isn’t edible; so once applied, there can be no more orals/rimming. But there is ‘Durex Play’, which comes in different flavors and is edible and wonderful to use; it is however expensive, compared to Lubrica.</p>

                            <p>Condoms have to be stored appropriately, if ownership is going to be for a long time, so that they don’t lose their essence when being used. They should be kept in cool and dry places, away from direct sunlight.</p>

                            <p>Before using any condom at all, endeavor to check its expiry date. Do not tear it open with the teeth. Every condom pack is designed with zigzag edges to make opening of it easy; use those edges. If the condom looks damaged or discolored, do not use. And I have a little tip to making condom usage not suck completely for the Top. Apply a drop of lube inside the condom itself and a little too on the penis before wearing it.</p>

                            <p>I generally would advice that the Bottom always be the one to put the condom on the Top. Sometimes, the Top could get too carried away with his haste to get inside to properly do the job. With one hand, pinch the tip of the condom to leave room for the ejaculate, and then place on the erect penis. With the other hand, roll the condom to the base of the erect penis. Continue using this hand to guide any air bubbles out of the condom. Then add lube to the outside of the condom to avoid excess friction that may cause breakage. If any faults are encountered during the sex due to condom tear or discomfort, change the condom and use another one and apply a lot of lube around and in the rectum to make it easier. During entry, the Bottom should be the one to guide the penis in.</p>

                            <p>After ejaculation, hold the base of the condom as you pull out to avoid slippage. Remove the condom and throw away in the trash, not the toilet.</p>

                            <p>To those who disregard usage of Gold Circle condoms because of its inexpensiveness, I would like to point out a few things. Gold Circle is one of the oldest condoms available. It is cheap because it is the condom amongst all condoms that the government has approved and the government highly subsidized the price to ensure affordability and readiness of its availability to anyone and everyone. This doesn’t make it a low quality condom. It is probably one of the best for the government to have approved its usage. It meets every international quality required and is of good quality. Produced overseas, it is merely sealed and packaged in Lagos, Nigeria for local usage. It is the only condom with a NAFDAC registration number on its box. It rarely breaks or malfunctions, even though it suffers the same problems as any other condom brand – user inexperience, overly rough or vigorous sex, alcohol or drug use or general inappropriateness in usage, and then inappropriate lubricant usage.</p>

                            <p>With this, nobody has an excuse to not use a condom because Gold Circle is very cheap and widely available and is still of good quality, and if you use the right lubricants with it, you would still get the wonderful sex experience. If you are so into flavored condoms, Gold Circle now comes in strawberry flavor and is quite nice and sweet to use.</p>

                            <p>Now I’m not saying you should deny yourself the fun and excitement that comes with sex or stop completely from having sex, but I believe that before going far deep and deciding to have sex without condoms, appropriate tests should be done because everybody has different histories and nobody can be too sure about anything; even an individual himself might be unaware of his conditions.</p>

                            <p>I actually belong to the school of thought that believes sex is important in relationships, and that sex helps in building a stronger bond, because if you get the sex you like, the way you like it, when you like it, and you are always excited to go back and have that sex, a sense of attachment comes in, and from there the relationship could get stronger because you have all you ever need in just that one person.</p>

                            <p>Let’s make this world a better place and keep ourselves and the younger generations to come safe.</p>

                            <h2>Stop The Hate!!</h2>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/stophate.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>To all the homophobic Christians who believe extremely and base their hate on the verse in the book of Leviticus, I want to point out this to you. The main 10 laws written down on tablets by God himself, review the fourth law. How many of you obey it? I mean in an entire full week, jus one day, only one day, keep it holy. How many of you do this. And keeping the Sabbath day holy as pointed out in the old testament goes beyond not committing any sin. It means resting, not doing any work of any sort. How many of you jus lay in bed all day doing nothing on the Sabbath day. Stop being hypocrites and spreading hate, based on laws in the old testament. Laws you yourself deep down have discarded. Stop the hate. I mean Jesus came with jus one law in the new testament. The commandment of LOVE. "Love your neighbour as you love yourself". He didn't say love only women because you are a man or love only men because you are a woman. So I put this to you, what if my neighbour is a man and I am a man, does this mean I shouldn't love him?? Stop the hate!!</p>
                            <p>One of my favourite quotes of all time is by Michael J. Sullivan and it states thus " People are afraid of what they do not understand ". I get it, your hatred is buried deep within your fear. Men are scared they could get raped by another man or not find any woman to marry and women are scared they won't get any man to marry but people, NOT EVERYONE IS GAY! The truth is the gay population isn't even as much as the heterosexual community. There's enough of everybody to go around. There are a whole lot of people in this world. God isn't dumb. He created everything and it is all perfect. For the men, how many gay rape situations have you ever heard or experienced. Stop being blind to the truth jus based on fear and assumptions and for the women, you don't have any man dating you, why not check your personality and reevaluate your situation. Gay people didn't jus mysteriously wake up one day and started screaming they want to be gay. You can't help who you love. It's high time we stop spreading the religion of hate and start spreading the religion of love as Jesus Christ clearly stated. Just my 2cents this evening. Feel free to crucify me. I know I can never be as influential as Jesus Christ and I believe a 100% in him and his teachings but most of you do not, simply because you jus don't get it. I leave you with this quote by Dorothy Parker, "Heterosexuality is not normal, it is jus common". Have a blessed Sunday.</p>
